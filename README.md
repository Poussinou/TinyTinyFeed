TinyTinyFeed
============

A Simple Widget to publish your [Tiny Tiny RSS Feeds](http://tt-rss.org) on your home screen

You need to have an account on a Tiny Tiny RSS installation (v1.12 at least) with the APIs enabled in order to use this widget.

The widget updates itself every 30 minutes and shows you the last 20 articles (you can change this value in the settings). 

Be aware that the widget update isn't in sync with the TTRss update.

Artworks from [Namida](https://www.facebook.com/NamidaArt) (or [here](http://boulangermaude.wix.com/namidaart)) - Kuddos to her
